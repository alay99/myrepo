**Introduction**

*The title of my project is Exploring Relationship between Wealth and Public Education in the United States.*

*The two datasets I've chosen are statesinfo, which has information about public high school education for each state and us_rent_income dataset, which has data about average income and rent of a household in each state.*

*The statesinfo dataset contains 8 variables: X:(state), region, pop: population of high school students who took SAT, SATV: S.A.T. verbal score, SATM: S.A.T math score, percent(percentage of graduating high school students who take S.A.T), dollars(state spending on public education in $1000 per student), pay:(average teachers salary). This dataset was acquired through CSV file of online data.The us_rent_income dataset contains 5 variables: GEOID, Name:(State), variable (rent or income), estimated average of that variable, and MOE(margin of error). This data was acquired from the all package function built in r from 1995.*


*These two datasets are interesting to me because Im curious to see how high school education effectiveness in a state is related to its overall wealth. Im also excited to see potential associations between the two datasets when matched on state, for example if you're raised in a particular state with a better education system, is it possible to predict your overall wealth(rent&income) in life, given that you did not move.*



```{r cars}


data(package= .packages(all.available = TRUE))

#install.packages("tidyr")
library(tidyr)
data("us_rent_income")

#imported read csv file into data frame statesinfo
statesinfo <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\amana\\OneDrive\\Documents\\SDS348\\Projects\\statesinfo.csv", header = TRUE)


```
**Tidy**

```{r}
#statesinfo dataset was already tidy
#used pivot wider on us_rent_income only since there were multiple observ.(rent and income) of variable and they could be organized into their own column
us_rent_income1 <- us_rent_income%>%pivot_wider(names_from = variable, names_glue = "{variable}_{.value}", values_from = c(estimate,moe))
us_rent_income1
```

**Join/Merge**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# renamed columns appropriately to state to allow for left join. Used left join to match on the fifty states +district of Columbia and dropped Puerto Rico, which was in us_rent_income dataset; it isnt considered a US state, had missing values for income, and its info was not provided in statesinfo dataset
#dropped GEOID from us_rent_income upon join since it didnt have meaningful info. 
us_rent_income1 <- us_rent_income1 %>% rename(state= "NAME")
statesdata <- statesinfo %>% rename(state= "X") %>% left_join(us_rent_income1[,c(-1)], "state")

```

**Summary Statistics**

#Used 6 dplyr functions 

#I was interested in exploring Texas metrics and other border states. Below shows filtering for only western south central states and arranging by percent(percentage of graduating high school students who take S.A.T)
#As expected, Texas compared to other states in the region who a significantly higher percentage 
statesdata %>% filter(region =="WSC") %>% arrange(desc(percent))

#used group_by on regions within US and found mean rent estimate of those regions
statesdata %>% group_by(region) %>% summarize(mean_rent_stimate = mean(rent_estimate)) 

#used mutate to make a new column for average SAT Score

statesdata %>% select(state, income_estimate, SAT_avg, pay) %>%  arrange(desc(SAT_avg))

*Findings: The Visualizations correlation matrix disproved my hypothesis there Wasn’t a strong correlation between SAT_avg and rent/income as predicted(-0.55). However, a higher SAT Score had a strong negative correlation with percent of students graduating from high school who took SAT(-0.87). My first ggplot of SAT avg vs income estimate grouped by region shows the disparity of education in each state even though region is similar. The second ggplot with stat=summary shows point error bars for the means of the region as a whole along with the individual data points. Its interesting to note that MA(Mid-Atlantic),NE(New England), and PAC (Pacific) region had some states with high dollars spent on a student's public education and higher teacher's salary  .*

*Findings: From the K-means plots, the population vs SAT_Avg it further confirms that a higher population can have a lower SAT_avg score, generally the less students who can graduate who took SAT can perform better. The third plot of income vs rent estimate shows the moderate cluster relationship between those, there is still regions of overlap. The fourth plot shows a weak relationship between pay and population, as it appears as vertical cluster. The fifth cluster of income estimate vs SAT_Avg shows weak cluster relationship. The other pam cluster is similar to 1st K-means plot and shows similar results. THe pam observations below indicate which serve states best as medoids. *
